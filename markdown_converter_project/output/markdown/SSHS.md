### Independent Contractor Agreement

Independent Contractor Agreements presented to potential and registered shoppers may be set up either as a Plain Text Document, or as a CMS document. The essential difference between the two setup types being that the Plain Text version of the agreement cannot be translated based on user preferred language.  
  
With intent to cover a global shopper database CMS documents can be used as a source of the Agreement.  
  
For ease of use the documents that can be listed as Source (template) are stored in a dedicated folder in your CMS under **_Public - > Templates -> Templates for User Contracts:_**

### Defining your new Agreement

If you are currently using a Text version of the agreement (indicated under the Source column) it is not mandatory to move to a new Agreement version.  
  
However, if you are currently using a CMS document as a template it is necessary to create a new Agreement version prior to moving to Shopper Signup v2.0.  
  


1\. Navigate to the Agreement management interface located under Administration -> Site Settings -> Agreement:

![](https://mediatraining.research-cloud.com/Download/GetFile.aspx?enc=hbwnGyGsOVHMlKweFQ49rbSXIs5jzt9eHXMJHo7LKRJw7GcifZQh1TvTA/NtPoeNHHcIZAZZr1ZKtjGi3gsU2RbhCL7KUoA93bjuebhxF4aoAzLoRAE2ucGXHFtrm37YnM2rKeh68eljCDZs5/UQOOihqrXO4ufngBMyBw8zcC5ico+1ALw6uBdK178dhKE5ygVRj+XtANmTEh2bYuSu3fsU3BQ12fPCjs+wY5C0JGZij08uvvotc5zUl1JCwzRe2lAzFWkzeL9U2a7qjtO7fJorhOb7rgRpcOYeV4dMDveeP7jci0T7+H4Nvm2nSyHnMdjE2VTy4t8ct8G6sm4GAAjK7zi2G/H5PPavYAE0eP6ngKD08s50inZ/EG9lMFqhcMlsgC33Ye9HE2J/1vW9SA==)

  


2. Click the New Agreement button to start the process of creating a new version.  
  
3\. Define the source of your new agreement with the available options being Text or CMS Document:

**NOTE:  Moving to a new version of the Independent Contractor Agreement is a business decision as much as it is a technological one. Once a new version of the agreement becomes available, all of your existing shoppers will be forced to sign it prior to being able to work on assignments again.**  
  


### General Disclosure and Privacy (GDPR Driven)

The General Data Protection regulation imposes specific requirements to communicate essential Privacy and Disclosure content prior official collection of data from Data Subjects. To facilitate this Update v96 introduces a collection of new CMS documents positioned under Public -> Privacy Content:  
  


![](https://mediatraining.research-cloud.com/Download/GetFile.aspx?enc=hbwnGyGsOVHMlKweFQ49rbSXIs5jzt9eHXMJHo7LKRJw7GcifZQh1TvTA/NtPoeNHHcIZAZZr1ZKtjGi3gsU2RbhCL7KUoA93bjuebhxF4aoAzLoRAE2ucGXHFtrm37YnM2rKeh68eljCDZs5/UQOOihqrXO4ufngBMyBw8zcC5ico+1ALw6uBdK178dhKE5kIzue/w/5QKc0spDAfdzj+Wx+RvL81ZZgdFDdYVPSp47BoF+p9U6AHkQ8riM0PnS3+3PLkok907kuN0qFTvKEF/Fcxt4GN/SBPwD8nGRLB2Ff9M4UBEEybO45xJQv3pj21R1P0mJQNJGOPujAkWH4DzHU8DT3BFY5eEgYA+YVgEuhPiCCLc6pqTg+JI7RCgqGVUxMderB0jYhrZpQa2pwg==)  
  
The content of the Additional Consents and Privacy Disclosures documents will be surfaced to EU Data Subjects (EU Shoppers) during Signup and on the dedicated My Privacy Dashboard (to be released with Shopmetrics Update v97).  
  
**NOTE:  As the GDPR defines specific requisites which must be included in General Privacy Disclosures, the respective document is restricted from editing by regular Admin users. To apply changes to the default content or introduce globalization via versioning of the CMS document please provide the content to your PAM. (for more information on this document and its uses please contact your PAM).**  
  
**NOTE:  The Additional Consents document is intended to store information intended to educate the Data Subject on how/where consent for Additional Purposes may be provided or revoked, as well as the purpose of the additional processing. This information differs from education on Explicit Consent for collecting Sensitive information. Should there be no purpose for collecting Additional Consent, the document may be left empty and will not display on the respective step in the signup process.**  
  


### Shopper Emails

The Shopper Signup v2.0 package introduces several new Email Templates used in the registration process or related features. The most significant update in these templates is that no password is included in the email body.  
  
To ensure that the verbiage used matches your corporate requirements it is recommended you edit these templates (only the ones including BODY in the name) and create versions in the languages you support.  
  
All email templates are located under **_Public - > Templates -> Templates for User Sign Up_**

**NOTE:  If you are unsure in what edits you need/can make please do not hesitate to contact your PAM.**  
  


### Update Logo

If you have a specific logo you would like to use in the signup (due to color compatibility or other consideration) please provide it matching the Logo dimensions below:

  


  * **Format:** .png
  * **Width:** 170px
  * **Height:** 60px



![](https://mediatraining.research-cloud.com/Download/GetFile.aspx?enc=hbwnGyGsOVHMlKweFQ49rbSXIs5jzt9eHXMJHo7LKRJw7GcifZQh1TvTA/NtPoeNHHcIZAZZr1ZKtjGi3gsU2RbhCL7KUoA93bjuebhxF4aoAzLoRAE2ucGXHFtrm37YnM2rKeh68eljCDZs5/UQOOihqrXO4ufngBMyBw8zcC5ico+1ALw6uBdK178dhKE5dSWns0QtqtZ2ctBrBx+3/GDVxYAgug7WJodgeADCqFp9zHIOYPH/k70cKeCYAy9M0wyD3X1M7H4JTzmTlliWEbDSsUbBgf4/ftU7T/bXGD5/9+qgFy5trwgigOi3wxP71iFFyjUWwoeK9o1ghEqaxqUuSXk9rWwGcroOaRiyBZq/LxnH47vDexqY7fSRryvNfb9oD9xRe5OHE/9hbrkR/A==)  
  


### Update Background Image

The background image in the Create Account, Log In and Forgot Password screens can be changed to match your corporate appearance.   
![](https://mediatraining.research-cloud.com/Download/GetFile.aspx?enc=hbwnGyGsOVHMlKweFQ49rbSXIs5jzt9eHXMJHo7LKRJw7GcifZQh1TvTA/NtPoeNHHcIZAZZr1ZKtjGi3gsU2RbhCL7KUoA93bjuebhxF4aoAzLoRAE2ucGXHFtrm37YnM2rKeh68eljCDZs5/UQOOihqrXO4ufngBMyBw8zcC5ico+1ALw6uBdK178dhKE5E7q1Qd4qhuqqt1YCsqmKvpHYPpqG3kpzRDAJxwIBvJxkqld+t06NZP+PGwK2+k0nYNruMFRTkORlrViEqYEdK/WbtXqQ2EHP9dxuiu1KMIczZpnPdIRU42JrT00uN9FOQgd8pwqFn1x1ExgiMi4Ag897Jd0wF6QMLgPKGC3a6W4SlKdYplXLzz/BPhqZwohI/2dwkpzEE+w7gSB7TuPfZg==)  
  
For that to happen, please provide your PAM with the desired image matching the design recommendations below.  
  
The image used for the background must be with dimensions 1920 x 1080 px. The picture will be stretched on wider screens so it should not be made smaller than those dimensions.  
  
For the page to load faster the image has to be optimized in size. An online tool like TinyJPG can be used for that purpose as it optimizes both jpg and png files.  
  


<https://tinyjpg.com/>   
  
The used image should be darker. Optimally a dark overlay with opacity should be applied to ensure that the content is visible. It will help if the image is blurred, but that is optional. Example:

![](https://mediatraining.research-cloud.com/Download/GetFile.aspx?enc=hbwnGyGsOVHMlKweFQ49rbSXIs5jzt9eHXMJHo7LKRJw7GcifZQh1TvTA/NtPoeNHHcIZAZZr1ZKtjGi3gsU2RbhCL7KUoA93bjuebhxF4aoAzLoRAE2ucGXHFtrm37YnM2rKeh68eljCDZs5/UQOOihqrXO4ufngBMyBw8zcC5ico+1ALw6uBdK178dhKE5zvj9rVG2aFN0Z8DQfeb73ezU/SZ4+LgfuYENKxkiVqOEAzKgcCjNDL087wKCkK3pQrswjV9+xDGFaO1Ofv69T5RHkxJdcv4vByKHU06tLDuHBWDSXU8q7yW9xIiYXvyTtr6cUHZdFzoMm5/WH2Dq3fz+8bIGBxebs3n3UTlhmnzLx6ihvQP2j40QsZd7dB0ZZTc/esrRVzmbBma6XesRHw==)  
  
Mobile version - You should know that the background image is resized when the page is opened in mobile device. We suggest that the main object in the image should be in the middle.  
  
For instance, this is a good example of an image that works good in both desktop and mobile:

To conform to the main principle of Transparency in the foundation of the GDPR, all Shopper Signup steps include a footer surfacing contact details for your company. In addition these details may include contact information for your Data Protection Officer/Contact in charge of personal data management - as mandated in the GDPR.  
  
To have these contact details surfaced to potential shoppers please provide them to your PAM.

### Business Decisions

**I. Can shoppers Skip and Continue on Profile Roadblock**  
  
As a result of the quick signup process shoppers receive their accounts with significant amount of data not populated in their profile. The largest portion of unanswered questions is usually located in the Extended Profile.  
  
By default a roadblock will stop any new/imported shoppers with missing information as soon as they log in and prompt them to complete their data.  
  
Taking into account the principle of data minimalization (asking only the necessary), Shopmetrics now allows you to enhance this roadblock with a Skip and Continue option. If selected, the shopper will not be stopped from navigating to their Inbox and Job Board.  
  
As a step in the transition process you will need to define which approach you would like to take with your shoppers (with the option to change it later): 

  * Block new shoppers (includes new signups and imported) and shoppers missing Extended Profile data on login 
  * Allow shoppers to skip and continue to provide further information at their convenience



**II. What languages is your signup going to be available in**  
  
While you can globalize all system texts in all languages it is important to understand that translating the actual Signup form requires the assistance of your PAM.  
  
While your PAM will help translate the form, it is important to note that new languages will not be automatically included when enabled from your Site Settings.   
  
**III. What (if any) are your password requirements**  
****  
****With the transition to a new Change Password and Forgot Password tools you now have the capability to help shoppers boost their Password strength by predefining format requirements. Existing Shoppers who try to change their pass and those passing through the registration process will have to meet these requirements when deciding on their pass.

Test process on training site

In the interest of a seamless and stable transition to Shopper Signup v2.0 we strongly recommend that you allocate sufficient time to prepare and test all resources on your dedicated training site prior to going live.  
  
As you and your PAM prepare resources and refine your business requirements, we recommend the following checklist of activities as prep for your successful transition: 

  * Confirm all necessary translations are in place and communicate instructions clearly
  * Confirm content and localized versions of the Independent Contractor Agreement match your business requirements
  * Confirm all Shopper facing emails have the correct verbiage and translations for languages supported on your website
  * Confirm Password requirements are applied and met
  * Confirm images and logos used in the new interfaces match your corporate requirements and style



As an additional benefit, this transition step should allow your staff in charge of shopper management to prepare a FAQ for possible shopper queries.  
  


### System Translations

Several new system texts are introduced with the update package. For a smooth transition make sure to provide translations for these texts in the languages active on your website.  
  
You can use the table below to prepare your translations and provide them to your PAM or use the import functionality supported in globalization (for more information on this feature see the "Translate Literals via the Import-Export Function" section in article [Globalization](/document.asp?alias=knowledgebase#/article/827de847-b7c5-451f-a70e-735d32f08052)).

### FAQ

**Q: Is it mandatory for my business to transition to the new signup?**  
  
A: At this juncture transitioning to Shopper Signup v2.0 is not mandatory but is most recommended considering the new trends in registrations and the security considerations implied. In addition, Shopper Signup v2.0 delivers a modern experience across all platforms (PC and Mobile) as the first point of contact for potential shoppers.  
  
**Q: How does the system know which State and City the shopper is from if they don 't enter it during signup?**  
  
A: Shopmetrics maintains an extensive database of geography data which helps deduce the shopper's State and City based on the combination of Country and Postal Code they entered during the registration. In the limited cases in which the State or City cannot be deduced correctly the shopper is allowed to change these details after they log in.  
  
**Q: Can we modify what questions are included in the signup form?**  
  
A: While we recommend the default set of questions included in the signup form, additions can be made so that additional contact data, demographic details or even Extended Profile questions are included. To start the question modifying process please contact your PAM with the specifics of your request.  
  
**Q: Why do we need to have a new CMS document selected for the agreement when we have one set up already?**  
  
A: While we already support the usage of CMS documents for Independent Contractor Agreements, this was done by using an outdated method (iFrame) which is not compatible with the new signup process and does not perform well when used on mobiles.****  
  
**Q: Can we move to a CMS version of the agreement without asking old shoppers to sign it again? It will have the same content but we need to use a new document.**  
  
A: Yes, but this must be a coordinated effort with your PAM. It is in your best interest to tell you PAM which document you have prepared so that we can make the switch and remove the "Sign Agreement" roadblock for your existing shoppes.  
  
**Q: I have a custom login page and would like to keep it active. Is this possible?**  
  
A: Yes, it is possible to retain your custom login page, however, it may be wise to rework it slightly if there is too much difference between the design of the Create Account/Forgot Password screens and your Login Page. The goal would be to deliver a consistent look and feel. Please note that your PAM will have to apply minor changes to the login page (if it is located in the CMS) or provide instructions for your IT staff - the changes will allow the page to receive status messages such as "Your Account has been activated."  
  
**Q: What about the Unsuccessful Signup Attempts report? Do I still have that?**  
  
A: With the principle of data minimization and data privacy by default and by design in consideration, Shopmetrics is no longer storing the data of potential shoppers prior to the successful activation of the account (double-opted-in). The report will remain visible until you choose to hide it, but there will be no new data included in it once you transition to Shopper Signup v2.0.
